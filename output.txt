### Insights and Trends from the Dataset:

---

#### **1. Sales by Product Category**
- **Wine** ($746,498.59) and **liquor** ($802,691.43) dominate retail sales, together accounting for **~83% of total retail sales**.  
- **Beer** ($574,220.53) is the third-largest category but shows a massive **warehouse sales volume** ($6.5M), suggesting it’s primarily sold in bulk or wholesale channels.  
- **Non-alcohol** ($27,150.31) and **str_supplies** (e.g., wine totes, $2,234.90) are niche categories with minimal sales.  
- **Kegs** and **dunnage** have near-zero retail sales, likely due to specialized use (e.g., wholesale/restaurant sales or internal logistics).

---

#### **2. Yearly Sales Trends**
- **2019 was the peak year** ($958,179.83), nearly **6x higher than 2018** ($153,595.90).  
- **2020 sales** ($354,949.09) are incomplete (data only for Jan, Mar, Jul, Sep), but March 2020 saw a spike ($108,807.63), possibly due to pandemic stockpiling.  
- **2017** ($686,734.57) and **2018** had partial data, suggesting gaps in reporting or operational changes.

#### **3. Top-Performing Items**
- **Top 5 Retail Items** are all liquor/beer:  
  1. **Tito’s Handmade Vodka - 1.75L** ($27,580.50)  
  2. **Corona Extra** ($25,064.00)  
  3. **Heineken** ($17,761.00)  
  *Large bottle sizes dominate, likely for home consumption.*  
- **Wine** lacks representation in top items, suggesting fragmented sales across many SKUs.

---

#### **4. Monthly Trends and Seasonality**
- **December** consistently peaks (e.g., $131,634 in Dec 2017), likely due to holidays.  
- **March** shows strong sales (e.g., $108,807 in Mar 2020), possibly tied to St. Patrick’s Day or spring breaks.

- **Kegs** show a negative transfer (-1.0), likely a correction or return.

---

#### **8. Anomalies and Data Gaps**
- **Incomplete 2020 data** (only 4 months) skews yearly comparisons.  
- Negative values (e.g., warehouse sales for **Robert Kacher Selections LLC** at -1.0) suggest data entry errors.  
- **"Dunnage"** (packaging material) has $0 retail sales but -$121,307 warehouse sales, implying internal use or write-offs.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate data gaps** (e.g., missing 2018/2020 months) for completeness.  
2. **Audit negative transfers/warehouse sales** to resolve data quality issues.  
3. **Optimize inventory** for peak seasons (Dec/Mar) and high-performing categories (wine/liquor).  
4. **Leverage warehouse-heavy suppliers** (e.g., Crown Imports) for bulk discounts.  
5. Explore why **non-alcohol** and **str_supplies** underperform despite retail focus.
